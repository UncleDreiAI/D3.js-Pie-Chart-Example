## Dependencies

This project has the following dependencies:

- **D3.js**: A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. You can include it in your project by adding the following script tag to your `index.html` file:

  ```html
  <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
  ```

  Make sure to include this script tag before any other scripts that rely on D3.js.

- **Express**: A popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of tools and features that simplify the process of building web applications and APIs. Express allows you to handle HTTP requests, define routes, manage middleware, and render dynamic views.

  To add the "express" dependency to your project, you can follow these steps:

  1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:

     ```sh
     cd /Users/andrehinton/Projects/D3.js-Pie-Chart-Example
     ```

  2. Run the following command to install the "express" package:

     ```sh
     npm install express
     ```

  3. Once the installation is complete, you can include the "express" module in your project by requiring it in your JavaScript files:

     ```javascript
     const express = require("express");
     ```

  Make sure to require the "express" module before using any of its functionalities in your code.
